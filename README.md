## Tutorial
### Before you start
1. I personally recommend [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) IDEs ([WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/?fromMenu) for example) for development  
- Note: if you are a college student, you can apply for a free licence at [jetbrains.com/webstorm/buy](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/buy/#edition=discounts)  

2. If you are unfamiliar with pull requests, here is a guide from GitHub: [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)  

3. Since this app is developed with nodeJS + Express/Koa, I would recommend reading [nodeJS Guide](web-backend/Node.js/README.md) before going into development
