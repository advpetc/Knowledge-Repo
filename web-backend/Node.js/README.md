# Node.js
## Intro
Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/v8/) engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world
